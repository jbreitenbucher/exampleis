%
% \documentclass{woosterthesis} must be at the beginning of every IS. Options are the same as
% for the report class with some additional options, abstractonly, blacklinks, code, kaukecopyright, palatino, picins,
% maple, index, verbatim, dropcaps, euler, gauss, alltt,  woolshort, colophon, woosterchicago, and
% achemso. The kaukecopyright option will put the arch symbol with the word mark on the
% copyright page. The woosterthesis class is based on the report class. One thing to note is that
% the ``%'' symbol comments out all characters that follow it on the line.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%
% Checked on 9/24/21 and compiles with no fatal errors. Users must have the latest version of the TeXLive software and

This Independent Study was designed by Dr. Jon Breitenbucher.\newline
It was edited and set into type in Wooster, Ohio,\newline
using the \ifthenelse{\boolean{xetex}}{\XeTeX\ typesetting system designed by Jonathan Kew}{\LaTeX\ typesetting system designed by Leslie Lamport}\newline
and based on the original \TeX\ system of Donald Knuth.\newline
It was printed and bound by Office Services at The College of Wooster.

The text face is Adobe Garamond Pro, designed by Robert Slimbach.\newline
This is the Opentype version distributed by Adobe Systems\newline
