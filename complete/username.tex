%                                                       Example IS Template
%
% \documentclass{woosterthesis} must be at the beginning of every IS. Options are the same as
% for the report class with some additional options: abstractonly, acs, alltt, apa, blacklinks, chicago,
% code, colophon, dropcaps, euler, foreignlanguage, gauss, index, kaukecopyright, lshortwooster, maple, mla, palatino, picins,tikz,
% verbatim, wblack, and woostercopyright. The kaukecopyright option will put the arch symbol with the word mark on the
% copyright page. The woosterthesis class is based on the report class. One thing to note is that
% the ``%'' symbol comments out all characters that follow it on the line.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Checked on 8/26/22 and compiles with no fatal errors. Users must have the latest version of the TeXLive software and
% have installed all available packages from CTAN to ensure this thesis class compiles with no fatal errors. Also, you must
% run pdfLaTex, Biber, MakeIndex, padfLaTeX, pdfLaTeX to get all the numbering and references resolved. This is the
% first year the template uses Biber for references.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% use this declaration for a draft  version of your IS
\documentclass[10pt,palatino,code,picins,tikz,kaukecopyright,openright,lshortwooster,dropcaps,verbatim,index,euler]{woosterthesis}
% Note that you can specify the acs option to use the American Chemical Society citation format, apa option to use the American
% Psychological Association citation format, chicago option to use the Chicago citation format, mla option to use the Modern Language
% Association citation format, wblack option for a grayscale Wooster "W" on the cover, and scottie option for a grayscale Scottie Mascot
% on the cover. See exampleis_manual.pdf for an explanation of all the options.

%  There will be certain commands that you use frequently in the thesis. You can give these
%  commands new names which are easier for you to remember. You can also combine several
%  commands into a new command of your own. See The LaTeX Companion or Guide to LaTeX
%  for examples on defining your own commands. These are commands that I defined to cut
%  down on typing. You can enter your commands in the personal.tex file in the styles folder.
