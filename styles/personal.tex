% There will be certain commands that you use frequently in the thesis. You can give these
% commands new names which are easier for you to remember. You can also combine several
% commands into a new command of your own. See The LaTeX Companion or Guide to LaTeX for
% examples on defining your own commands. These are commands that I defined to cut down on typing.
